# RISK
Group of different python files I used to simulate and plot RISK dice throws to beat my friends.

This was made in early 2025 when I had statistics classes, as I was curious to apply law of great numbers (Loi des grands nombres)

DISCLAMER
I did not know how to organize my files back then, and therefore there is a real posibility that I may have uploaded the wrong files. They won't be used ever again, they're just here to display and I will not be bothered to check :)
